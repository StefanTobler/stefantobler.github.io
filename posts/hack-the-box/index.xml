      <description>This was a good box to get back in the swing of things, it gave me a good challenge, and reminded me of how difficult it can be to google for Windows enum tools. Besides that, it was a good reminder of how to interact with SMB and showed me a new place to look for user command history in Windows.</description>

      <description>This box was really cool for a few reasons. First off we bypass authentication using one of the OWASP Top 10, then continue to upload a reverse shell by tricking the web server into believing we are uploading a .</description>

      <description>Remote was a very cool windows box that required us to discover a vulnerability in their CMS, after discovering an exposed file system that contained a backup. Once on the machine we can find out that there are some misconfigured privileges.</description>

      <description>This machine was challenging, but I learned a lot. I learned how to make &amp;ldquo;smarter&amp;rdquo; shells and how to upload the pspy script to a remote server. I wonder if I could have completed this machine without adding my public ssh key, because at the moment it is very identifiable.</description>
