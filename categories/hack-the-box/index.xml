      <description>This box was really cool for a few reasons. First off we bypass authentication using one of the OWASP Top 10, then continue to upload a reverse shell by tricking the web server into believing we are uploading a .</description>

      <description>Remote was a very cool windows box that required us to discover a vulnerability in their CMS, after discovering an exposed file system that contained a backup. Once on the machine we can find out that there are some misconfigured privileges.</description>

      <description>This machine was challenging, but I learned a lot. I learned how to make &amp;ldquo;smarter&amp;rdquo; shells and how to upload the pspy script to a remote server. I wonder if I could have completed this machine without adding my public ssh key, because at the moment it is very identifiable.</description>

      <description>Fuzzy challenged the user on the basics of fuzzing and taught me how to use wfuzz and other techniques to learn information about my target machine. I suggest anyone who would like to learn about fuzzing take on this challenge.</description>
