      <description>This was a good box to get back in the swing of things, it gave me a good challenge, and reminded me of how difficult it can be to google for Windows enum tools. Besides that, it was a good reminder of how to interact with SMB and showed me a new place to look for user command history in Windows.</description>

      <description>Remote was a very cool windows box that required us to discover a vulnerability in their CMS, after discovering an exposed file system that contained a backup. Once on the machine we can find out that there are some misconfigured privileges.</description>

      <description>This machine was challenging, but I learned a lot. I learned how to make &amp;ldquo;smarter&amp;rdquo; shells and how to upload the pspy script to a remote server. I wonder if I could have completed this machine without adding my public ssh key, because at the moment it is very identifiable.</description>

      <description>Blue explores the dated, but widespread EternalBlue exploit. This exploit was used in the WannaCry ransomware attack which crippled healthcare systems and spread to millions of computers in a matter of days. In this room we are prompted to exploit this vulnerability using Metasploit.</description>

      <description>Ice is the extension to the Blue room. In this room we learn more about windows recon, exploitation and escalation. This box uses a vulnerable service called Icecast which allows us to access the machine using metasploit, then elevate those privileges by abusing a spool process.</description>
